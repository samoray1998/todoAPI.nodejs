**Todo_rest_API**
I tried in this project to illustrate how easy it's to build a node js API

To start with this project clone this project on you local machine by running this command in terminal /n
```git clone https://github.com/samoray1998/todoAPI.nodejs.git ```

after that go to this folder todoAPI.nodejs
```cd ~/todoAPI.nodejs```
and run bellow command to install all packages in your project 
```npm install```
the last step is to run your project and test it on postman
```npm start```
